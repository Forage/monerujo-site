# Where Monerujo stores your wallets

Since version 2.0.3 'Puginarug' Monerujo changed the place where it saves your wallets files. Let's break it down:

## How it was before:
Until now, wallets were saved in the normal storage the apps on your phone use for all the files or stuff you produce in them. For example, that's the place your camera app stores the photos you take. This regular storage had no particular protection, and technically every app has access to every file that's in there. That's how you can install two different audio players, and they can find the same stored songs. That's also why Monerujo (and any other app that works with files) needed to ask for your permission to "Access your files and photos." when you install it for the first time. Monerujo needed your permission to save stuff on that storage.

When Monerujo creates a new wallet or restores a previous one, it creates a couple of files with that wallet's name, and encrypts the sensitive one of them with the CrAzYpass. You can read more about it on this article. But basically the CrAzYpass is a crazy secure password made up of a combination of the password you choose, and an identifier of the phone. It is very long and impossibly hard to crack, so your funds were very safe, even though they were on this easily accesible storage.
